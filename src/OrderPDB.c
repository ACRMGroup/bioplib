   \param[in]     Renum   TRUE: Renumber the atoms
   \return                 Corrected PDB linked list

   Runs through a PDB linked list and corrects the atom order to match
   the N,CA,C,O,s/c standard. Only standard amino acids are processed.
   The input linked list is modified (i.e. a new list is not built),
   but the return value from the routine should be used for the corrected
   list rather than the input PDB pointer, since the start of the list
   may have changed. i.e. the routine should be called with the form:

                  pdb = FixOrderPDB(pdb,TRUE,TRUE);
